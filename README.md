# Setting R Development Environment with VScode and Docker

üößWIP üèóÔ∏è, pre spell checkingüõ†Ô∏è

This repo provides a step-by-step guide and a template for setting up an R development environment with VScode and Docker üê≥. Docker is an amazing tool, but it has some learning curve. This tutorial aims to reduce the entry barrier for learning tools such as Docker.

## Motivation

This section focuses on the advantages of using Docker with VScode and explains the motivation for using R with VScode.

### Why develop with Docker üê≥?

Docker is a CI/CD tool that enables seamless code deployment from development to production environments. By creating OS-level virtualization, it can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container and ship it between different environments. The main advantages of using Docker within your development environment are:
- **Reproducibility -** Docker enables you to seamlessly package your code and its dependencies into a single container and execute, test, share, and deploy it with a high level of consistency
- **Collaboration -** Docker solves the dependencies madness when a team of developers works together on a specific project. Having a unified environment saves a ton of time during the development step. For example, if one developer gets some error, it is easy for other developers to reproduce the error and help debug it
- **Deployment -** Docker simplifies the code shipment from the development environment to the production

While Docker usually rhymes with DevOps and CI/CD, it is a great tool for data science and engineering applications, in particular, MLOps. 

One of the core foundations of data science is the ability to reproduce your work, regardless of the user or machine the job is running. This is where Docker is shining by solving the lack of consistency between environments that cause many of us pain and grief. 

In addition, Docker as a CI/CD tool plays a pivotal role in MLOps as it enables seamless deployment of data science and engineering applications such as data pipelines and automation, model deployment, etc.

### Why VScode üíª?

VScode (aka Visual Studio Code) is a general-purpose free code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be run locally on Windows, macOS, and Linux OSs or on a cloud environment. The main advantages of using VScode as your IDE are:
- **Multi-languages -** VScode supports out-of-the-box JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and has a variety of extensions that enable running other programming languages such as Python, C++, C#, Go, etc.
- **Extensions -** VScode has a large community support that builds and maintains a variety of extensions that extend the editor's capabilities and functionality. That includes extensions that support programming languages (such as Python, R, and Julia), plugs-in that enables connection with external applications (Docker, Postgres, etc.), and other applications
- **Git integration -** VScode has built-in integration with Git
- **Docker integration -** VScode supports natively Docker integration, which we will dive deep into in the coming sections

The main advantage of VScode is the native Docker integration, which enables the opening of a project in a containerized environment. In addition, in many senses, VScode is a DIY IDE that enables a high level of freedom of customization. On the other hand, the downside of VScode is that for most programming languages, VScode will not be an "out-of-box" IDE. It requires both knowledge and some level of effort to customize it to work with languages such as Python, R, etc.


### Why R with VScode?!?

After we discussed Docker and VScode, it is time to address the elephant in the room - why use R with VScode when you have such a great IDE for R - RStudio? The short answer is Docker. 

If Docker is not part of your workflow, you are more than welcome to continue reading this tutorial and learn how to run R with VScode, but RStudio would be the best IDE for you. 

On the other hand, if Docker is part of your workflow (or you wish to adopt it), it is worth, in my opinion, the effort of customizing VScode to run R. Besides running your code inside a dockerized environment, VScode has additional advantages:
- A variety of extensions and add-ons, such as tools for documentation (Draw.io, Markdown, Quarto, etc.), databases (Postgres, Snowflake, etc.), and other utility tools (JSON, YAML viewers, etc.)
- Support for multiple languages such as JS, HTML, Python, Bash, etc.

Last but not least, to set expectations before starting, even with all the awesome extensions and customization we can use to set R, it won't feel as native as RStudio. It's just different.

**Note:** While RStudio does not support Docker, you can run an RStudio Server inside a dockerized environment. This approach required some level of customization, but the use of this is under the AGPL-3 license.


## Scope

This tutorial focuses on setting up a dockerized R development environment with VScode. We will explore how to integrate VScode with Docker using Microsoft's Dev Container extensions and show various methods for configuring an R environment with Docker. That includes the following settings:
- Set a template for a dockerized R environment
- Define environment variables
- Set a code editor and debugger
- Set support for Shiny, Quarto, htmlwidgets, plots, table viewer, etc.
- Enable to launch multiple R sessions in parallel
- Set code snippet

However, it's important to note that while this tutorial covers some of the core Docker features, it is not a complete Docker guide. If you don't have previous experience with Docker, I highly recommend taking one of the Docker crash courses.


## Prerequisites

Generally, this tutorial does not require previous experience with Docker and VScode. In line with the tutorial scope above, the goal is to teach you how to set up an R development environment using Docker and VScode. That being said, as mentioned above, you will benefit more from and highly utilize this tutorial if you take some Docker intro courses before starting this tutorial.
The main requirements for this tutorial are setting VScode and Docker Desktop. In addition, you will need to set up an account with Docker Hub.

### Installing VScode

Installing VScode is straightforward - go to the VScode website https://code.visualstudio.com/ and click on the Download button (purple rectangle on the screenshot):

</figure>


Download the installation file and follow the instructions. 

To set a dockerized environment in VScode we will need to install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension, which enables to open a folder and execute a code inside a Docker container.

Here is how to install an extension on VScode: 
- Click the Extensions button on the left menu (mark with a purple arrow on the screenshot below) 
- Type the extension name on the search menu (see the yellow rectangular). You can see the search results below, and clicking on each extension will open a window with the extension details. 
- Last but not least, Click the install button (see the green rectangular) to install the extension

**Note:** The Dev Containers extension is required to launch the dockerized environment. We will see later in this tutorial how to set and install the necessary extensions for your dockerized environment automatically with the `devcontainer.json` file.
